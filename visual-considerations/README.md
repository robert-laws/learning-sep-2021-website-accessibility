# Visual Considerations

## Color Contrast

WebAIM has a [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

Will review text - normal, large, and graphical and UI components.

Forms can be an issue, particularly when showing errors or success borders around input elements. In these cases, it's important not to rely only on color to indicate the state of the form.

## Visual Impairments

There are a variety of visual impairments that can make it difficult to use websites. For example, it's useful to keep notifications close to the content they refer to for users who have a restricted field of vision.

## Neurocognitive Impairments

Some accessibility options are available within the operating system to help users with disabilities. For example, the "prefers-reduced-motion" setting in Windows 10 can be used to reduce the motion of the screen.

The "prefers-reduced-motion" setting can also be used in browsers to detect user settings and offer a reduced motion experience.

## Color Schemes

It's possible to set a color scheme in the operating system settings. This setting can be used with the "prefers-color-scheme" setting to provide a color scheme that's optimized for a user's visual preferences.
